# ovh-vps-autorebuild
This package will automate the rebuild / reinstall of your OVHcloud VPS in a matter of seconds

# Installation

The very first step is the installation of OVH's official Python wrapper which works with Python 3.6+

The easiest way to get the latest stable release is to grab it from pypi using pip.

```pip install ovh```

Alternatively, you may get latest development version directly from Git.

```pip install -e git+https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh.git#egg=ovh```

People looking for Python 2 compatibility should use 0.6.x version.
